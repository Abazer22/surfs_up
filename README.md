# Surfs Up 
# Project Overview
This project explores the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu ,to review weather patterns in Hawaii as we look to open a surf and ice cream shop. This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two periods to help assess whether an ice cream/surf shop would have good weather conditions in which to operate.
# THE RESULTS
The following tables summarize June's temperature statistics over time.

# Summary
Oevrall the weather in December and June are  very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
